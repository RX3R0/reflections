Lesson 2 Reflections

What happens when you initalise a repository?  Why do you need to?

The initialisation process creates the required metadata needed to
keep track of the project.  Without it, there would be no way to track
the history or do anything else.


How is the staging area different from the working directory and the
repository?  What value do you think it offers?

The working directory is usually where all the files that are being
edited are stored.  The staging area is the space where files are
added before they can be commited.  On commit, the files in the
staging area are added to the repository.

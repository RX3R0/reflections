Lesson 2 Reflections

What happens when you initalise a repository?  Why do you need to?

The initialisation process creates the required metadata needed to
keep track of the project.  Without it, there would be no way to track
the history or do anything else.


How is the staging area different from the working directory and the
repository?  What value do you think it offers?

The working directory is usually where all the files that are being
edited are stored.  The staging area is the space where files are
added before they can be commited.  On commit, the files in the
staging area are added to the repository.


How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per
logical change?

After each logical change, add the file or files with the logical
change to the staging area.  To ensure that this is the change that is
to be be committed, compare it to the working directory and to the
most recent commit, or to the commit where the bug was introduced in
the case of a bug fix.

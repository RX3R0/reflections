# Reflections

Reflections from each of the three lessons in the [How to Use Git and Github](https://www.udacity.com/course/how-to-use-git-and-github--ud775)
course on Udacity.  

The main purpose of the reflections is the help cement the concepts into the
mind.  Also, since the course is not a programming course, practise with git and
version control is done mainly using these files.

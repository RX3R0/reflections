When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

Keeping data in multiple locations is a good redundancy measure (if redundancy 
is the right term). If, for example, something happened to the local work and it
got corrupted, deleted, or otherwise lost, then it could be restrieved from the 
remote repository.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having
Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Pulling changes automatically may make changes to the local repository
while work is still being done.  Manually pulling, say, after work is
finished or before it starts would be better.

When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

Keeping data in multiple locations is a good redundancy measure (if redundancy 
is the right term). If, for example, something happened to the local work and it
got corrupted, deleted, or otherwise lost, then it could be restrieved from the 
remote repository.
